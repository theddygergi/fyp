# Google Captcha Speech Transcription

This script is designed to transcribe speech data from WAV files using the Google Speech Recognition service. It is particularly useful for transcribing audio data captured from Google Captcha challenges.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- `speech_recognition` library available (can be installed via pip)

## Usage

1. Import the `transcribe_wav` function from the script.
2. Provide the path to the WAV file as an argument to the function.
3. The function loads the WAV file, listens for the audio data, and transcribes it using the Google Speech Recognition service.
4. If the transcription is successful, the function returns the recognized text.


## Important Note

Ensure that you have a stable internet connection while using this script, as it relies on the Google Speech Recognition service for transcription. Additionally, note that the accuracy of transcription may vary depending on the quality of the audio and background noise.

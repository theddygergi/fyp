# TikTok Copyright Report Automation Script

This Python script automates the process of submitting copyright infringement reports on TikTok's platform.

This repository contains two scripts for automating the process of submitting copyright reports on TikTok. Each script serves a different purpose:

1. **Multiple Accounts Script**: This script automates the submission of copyright reports using multiple Outlook accounts. You need to provide an Excel file containing names, emails, and passwords for each Outlook account.

2. **Single Account Script**: This script submits copyright reports using a single TikTok account. It simplifies the process by requiring only one set of credentials.
